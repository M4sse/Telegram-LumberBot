# Running

- Open the game.
- Position it: Left screen, left side with full height. You need to have a
  1080p Monitor. Adjust the width to the games width. The black bars have to
  dissapear, but do not make the game resize itself. (It is a little tolerant.)
- Prepare the game to the point where it is ready to play, but the timer not
  yet running.
- Run your exe and wait for it.
